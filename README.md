### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Geologist since 2013, currently in the process of professional transition to Data Analyst. I have dedicated most of my professional life to research in different Universities. In 2021 I decided to make the transition to Data Analyst acquiring experience in Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn or Beautiful Soup, as well as SQL.
